### How to Use the Disk Usage Script with Matplotlib and Plotly Visualization Options

This Python script is designed to help you analyze the disk usage of folders on your drive, specifically focusing on the parent folders within a specified root directory (e.g., `D:\`). It calculates the total size of each folder and provides options to visualize the data using either `matplotlib` (for static pie charts) or `plotly` (for interactive pie charts).

#### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python packages:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `plotly`
  
  You can install these packages using pip if they are not already installed:

  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib plotly
  ```

### Script Overview and Features

1. **Calculate Folder Sizes:**
   - The script traverses the parent folders within a specified root directory (e.g., `D:\`) and calculates the total size of each folder.
   - It automatically ignores files that cannot be accessed due to permission issues or other errors.

2. **Visualize Data with a Pie Chart:**
   - You can choose to generate either a static pie chart using `matplotlib` or an interactive pie chart using `plotly`.
   - The script defaults to using `matplotlib` for the pie chart, but you can opt to use `plotly` by setting a parameter.

3. **Customization:**
   - The chart can be customized to display folder sizes in either MB or GB, depending on the size of each folder.
   - You can easily switch between static and interactive charts by changing a single argument in the function call.

### How to Use the Script

#### 1. **Setting the Root Directory:**
   - The script operates on a root directory, which you can specify at the beginning of the script. By default, this is set to `D:\`:
   ```python
   root_directory = "D:\\"
   ```

#### 2. **Running the Script:**
   - The main function to run is `inspect_parent_folders`, which performs the folder size calculations and generates the pie chart.
   - The `inspect_parent_folders` function takes two arguments:
     1. `root_dir`: The root directory to analyze (e.g., `"D:\\"`).
     2. `use_plotly`: A boolean flag to determine whether to use `plotly` for an interactive pie chart. By default, this is `False`, meaning the script will use `matplotlib` for a static pie chart.

   - **To use the default `matplotlib` chart**:
     ```python
     inspect_parent_folders(root_directory)
     ```

   - **To use an interactive `plotly` chart**:
     ```python
     inspect_parent_folders(root_directory, use_plotly=True)
     ```

#### 3. **Viewing the Output:**
   - If you choose `matplotlib`, a static pie chart will be displayed, showing the proportion of disk usage for each parent folder.
   - If you choose `plotly`, an interactive pie chart will open in your web browser, allowing you to hover over slices to view detailed information about each folder's size.

### Additional Features

- **Label Information**: The pie chart labels show the folder names along with their sizes in MB or GB.
- **Auto-Scaling of Units**: The script automatically converts folder sizes to GB if they exceed 1 GB, ensuring the chart is easy to read.
- **Parallel Processing**: The script uses parallel processing to calculate folder sizes, making it faster, especially when dealing with a large number of files.
- **Error Handling**: The script is designed to skip over files that cannot be accessed due to permissions or other errors, ensuring it completes without interruption.

### Customization and Expansion

- **Save Chart as HTML (Plotly)**: If you use `plotly`, you can save the chart as an HTML file for later viewing or sharing:
  ```python
  fig.write_html("disk_usage_pie_chart.html")
  ```

- **Export Data to CSV**: You can extend the script to export the calculated folder sizes to a CSV file, which is useful for further analysis or record-keeping.

- **Additional Visualizations**: You can add more visualizations, such as bar charts or sunburst charts, to provide different perspectives on the data.

- **Email Reports**: For automated reporting, you can integrate email functionality to send the generated charts and data as attachments.

### Conclusion

This script provides a flexible and efficient way to analyze and visualize disk usage on your system. By offering both static and interactive visualization options, it caters to different use cases and preferences. Whether you're monitoring disk space for personal use or managing resources in an organization, this script can help you gain valuable insights quickly and effectively.

Feel free to customize and expand the script further to suit your specific needs!
